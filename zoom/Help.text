This behavior pack was made in order to use function command, this command execute a command in a corresponding function file. You can edit the file for your custom /function command.

Go in folder name functions here are all files that has a command for /function command. Open one of this file as a text then you can see all of the command in the game. Example you edit the file and you put a command "say hello" then this command will execute when you use this for function command.

You can renamed the file anything you like, don't renamed the extension name(.mcfunction). And this is the named you need to use in /function command. For example you renamed "invulnerable.mcfunction" file to "test.mcfunction" so now in the game you need to do is "/function test" to run all commands in this file.

After you edit the file do /reload to reload the file in behavior pack.
